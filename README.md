# OOPS In Java

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, a 
programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects."
Objects are instances of classes, which are blueprints
for creating objects. OOP focuses on using objects to
represent real-world entities, enabling more modular,
reusable, and organized code.


### Reference Documentation
## key concepts of OOP

### Class
Blue Print of an Object(Entity)
### Object
Object/Entity is an Instance of class. It Occupies memory.

## Core Concepts

There are 3 Pillars and 1 Principle of OOPS

### Principles
- Abstraction
  - Abstraction tells us to envision complex system in terms of 
  Ideas/Entities
  - Ex: When Designing an Ecommerce Application, Simplify the 
  complexity by envisoning the complex system into entities
  like users , Products, Orders , Payments , Carts , Ratings etc.
  - We dont want to Know the inner details of each entity 
    We hide the complexity behind each Entity , Rather we simply 
  the system in terms of Entities
  - As a Summary Abstraction tells us to Envision the system 
  in terms of entities/ Ideas hiding the complex details.


### Pillar
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance 
- Polymorphism
